# About
This implementation is a Windows Form written in C#.
It's main purpose is to simplify and manage the creation of crochet, knitting, embroidery, stitching patterns.
This program lets you create patterns in a grid or a flowchart then save the pattern as a work file or image.
This program also contains a generator of embroderiy that will let you easily create new embroderies of real life objects.
